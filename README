This is a repository for the basic implementation of the algorithms for my Math 350 class: Introduction to  graph theory.

Current implementations: 

Havel-Hakimi - This is not a particularly hard algorithm to implement, so I decided to write it in Python to catch up on the language.
               I haven't really written anything in Python in about 2 years. Eventually I will write this using a recursive algorithm.

Future implementations:

Dijkstra's shortest path
